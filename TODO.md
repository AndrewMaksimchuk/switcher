## Before first release

* Settings
* Whatever account creation and other fluff there is to get it on e.g.o

## After release

* Better matching (perhaps something Helm-style)
* highlighting the matched parts in the texts
* Arrow navigation of matched rows and highlighting of currently selected row
* Activating with double modifier key (shift, alt, ctrl) if at all possible with JS only
* Explicit visual cancel and enter buttons
