# From feedback
* customizing look and feel with themes
* font is too big and UI fills whole screen on 1600x900 (should be customizable)

# Otherwise
* highlighting the matched parts in the texts
* Activating with double modifier key (shift, alt, ctrl) if at all possible with JS only
* Explicit visual cancel and enter buttons
